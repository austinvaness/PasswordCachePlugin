# Password Cache Plugin
This plugin saves the passwords entered for servers so that you dont need to enter them again. Passwords are not saved after the game is closed.

## Installation
In order to use this plugin, you must install [Plugin Loader](https://github.com/austinvaness/PluginLoader). After installing Plugin Loader, simply find and enable Password Cache in the plugin list from the game menu.
